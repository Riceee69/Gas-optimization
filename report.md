# High Issues

## H-1: Functions send eth away from contract but performs no checks on any address.

Consider introducing checks for `msg.sender` to ensure the recipient of the money is as intended.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 287](src/Gas.sol#L287)

	```solidity
	    receive() external payable {
	```

- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 291](src/Gas.sol#L291)

	```solidity
	    fallback() external payable {
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Ownable.sol [Line: 77](src/Ownable.sol#L77)

	```solidity
	    function renounceOwnership() public virtual onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/Ownable.sol [Line: 85](src/Ownable.sol#L85)

	```solidity
	    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual onlyOwner {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 288](src/Gas.sol#L288)

	```solidity
	        payable(msg.sender).transfer(msg.value);
	```

- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 292](src/Gas.sol#L292)

	```solidity
	        payable(msg.sender).transfer(msg.value);
	```

</details>



## L-3: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 2](src/Gas.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```

- Found in src/Ownable.sol [Line: 2](src/Ownable.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```

</details>



## L-4: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Ownable.sol [Line: 96](src/Ownable.sol#L96)

	```solidity
	        _owner = newOwner;
	```

</details>



## L-5: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

<details><summary>8 Found Instances</summary>

	```solidity
	    function getPaymentStatus(address sender) public view returns (bool, uint256) {
	```

</details>



## L-6: Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals

If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

<details><summary>4 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 244](src/Gas.sol#L244)

	```solidity
	        if (_tier > 3) {
	```

- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 246](src/Gas.sol#L246)

	```solidity
	        } else if (_tier > 0 && _tier < 3) {
	```

- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 274](src/Gas.sol#L274)

	```solidity
	        require(_amount > 3, "Gas Contract - whiteTransfers function - amount to send have to be bigger than 3");
	```

</details>



## L-7: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 79](src/Gas.sol#L79)

	```solidity
	    event AddedToWhitelist(address userAddress, uint256 tier);

	```solidity
	    event PaymentUpdated(address admin, uint256 ID, uint256 amount, string recipient);
	```

</details>



## L-8: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 2](src/Gas.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```

- Found in src/Ownable.sol [Line: 2](src/Ownable.sol#L2)

	```solidity

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 102](src/Gas.sol#L102)

	```solidity
	    modifier checkIfWhiteListed(address sender) {
	```

</details>



## L-10: Potentially unused `private` / `internal` state variables found.

State variable appears to be unused. No analysis has been performed to see if any inilne assembly references it. So if that's not the case, consider removing this unused variable.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 68](src/Gas.sol#L68)

	```solidity
	    PaymentType constant defaultPayment = PaymentType.Unknown;
	```

</details>



## L-11: Boolean equality is not required.

If `x` is a boolean, there is no need to do `if(x == true)` or `if(x == false)`. Just use `if(x)` and `if(!x)` respectively.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 184](src/Gas.sol#L184)

	```solidity
	        return ((status[0] == true), _tradeMode);
	```

- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 215](src/Gas.sol#L215)

	```solidity
	        return (status[0] == true);
	```

</details>



## L-12: Loop condition contains `state_variable.length` that could be cached outside.

Cache the lengths of storage arrays if they are used and not modified in for loops.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 151](src/Gas.sol#L151)

	```solidity
	        for (uint256 ii = 0; ii < administrators.length; ii++) {
	```

</details>



## L-13: Costly operations inside loops.

Invoking `SSTORE`operations in loops may lead to Out-of-gas errors. Use a local variable to hold the loop computation result.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 128](src/Gas.sol#L128)

	```solidity
	        for (uint256 ii = 0; ii < administrators.length; ii++) {
	```

	```solidity
	        for (uint256 ii = 0; ii < payments[_user].length; ii++) {
	```

</details>



## L-14: State variable could be declared constant

State variables that are not updated following deployment should be declared constant to save gas. Add the `constant` attribute to state variables that never change.

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>

	```solidity
	    uint256 public tradePercent = 12;

	    function addHistory(address _updateAddress, bool _tradeMode) public returns (bool status_, bool tradeMode_) {
	```

</details>
